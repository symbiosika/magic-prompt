Functions: You can define simple functions.
Each function has a output-variable and a name that has to be defined as minimum.
There is also an optional second variable "memory" which is always output as array with all generated answers.
Normally a function generates text since we are working with LLMs here!

Each function is a simple Dialog.
All happenings here will not be appended to the main chat.

{{#function name=generate_question memory=asked_questions output=actual_question}}
    {{#role=system}}
        You will create random questions.
    {{/role}}

    {{#role=user}}
        Create a question.
        You have already asked these questions:
        {{asked_questions}}
        DonÂ´t repeat yourself.
    {{/role}}

The main logic are blocks.
A "block" describes a Dialog which will be send to the LLM with one request!
Per default all blocks will be added to the main chat.
If you want to hide a block from the main chat you can add "forget=true".
If you execute complex Dialogs where some prompts have confidential information
you can hide that.
